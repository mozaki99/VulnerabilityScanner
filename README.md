<h1>Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is an attempt at looking for vulnerabilities in a single host environment (Windows 10). This could be done by launching a virtual machine running Windows 10 and disabling firewalls and enabling remote scanning. I also downloaded an older version of firefox to see what this would show on the scan and compared the number of detected vulnerabilites at each stage. Lastly I followed the recommended remediation process given by the Nessus software and completed a final scan.

<h2>Software used</h2>

- <b>VMWare Workstation 16 Player</b> 
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

Enabling Remote Registry so that Nessus can perform a credentialed scan later on:  <br/>

Adding new registry policy and changing the binary value to 1:

<br />
<br />
After this is done I used command prompt to view the IP address of the VM and pinged this on my main device : <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now the VM can be scanned on Nessus Essentials so I first did a basic scan:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
There was only 1 medium detected vulnerability in the initial scan. As it was clear that there are more vulnerabilities it was time to do a credentialed scan - using the password of the VM host:  <br/>

After enabling credentials, results of the second scan:  <br/>

<br />
I then installed an older version of firefox to observe how this would reflect on the vulnerability of the VM host:  <br/>

Using the Nessus Software, the top 10 vulnerabilities found were displayed.

I then followed the software's recommended remediation steps against these vulnerabilities:  <br/>

<br />
Instead of updating firefox I decided to just uninstall it and only update Windows, as I didn't want to strain my laptop with multiple updates: <br/>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
Some choices made in this small project I noticed could be different if this was a multi-host environment such as a business. For example, when I chose to uninstall firefox instead of updating it, this would have to be evaluated from a business standpoint whether it is feasible, as the business could be impacted if it uses firefox as a web browser for example. Additionally the function used by Nessus to showcase the top 10 vulnerability would be more effective in a business where there may be conflicting priorities, so remediating the top threats and allocating time and resources to them is improtant. If I was to improve this project I would try to automate some of the processes as it is more convenient to have periodic scans that notify you of vulnerabilities. Additionally if I was to think of using this in a business environment I would use it alongside maintainence of OS updates so that the scans are mostly up to date and automated.
